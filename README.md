# DEGENERACY: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY

***THE COLLISION OF THE STAGNANT MIND, AND A MIND SEEKING KNOWLEDGE***

Welcome, welcome. Feast your eyes on one of the lonliest repositories to ever grace GitHub - `That's right`

- ðŸ§  Iâ€™m currently working on the `foundations of computer science` and the applications therein
- ðŸ’€ Iâ€™m currently learning programming languages like `Python` and `SQL`
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything `coding` related for `pre-noobs`
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with `structuring` and `success planning`
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything (more specifically my pervious line of work lol)
- â˜Ž How to reach me: `Rotary phone`
- ðŸ›’ Fun fact: I am taking the leap to pursuing a career in IT after `9` long, painful, `soul-sucking`, knowledge-deprived years in the retail industry. My oh my, what a `waste of time and happiness`. Oh well, let's get started, shall we?

I'm also reppin' my boy, `Harv`. If you have any problems with the former, `kindly` make your way to the nearest `hardware store...`
